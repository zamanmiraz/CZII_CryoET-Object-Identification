**Tomography:** Tomography is a technique for imaging the internal structure of an object by capturing a series of 2D cross-sectional images at different angles. These images are then reconstructed computationally to form a 3D representation of the object. 
Applications: Medical imaging (e.g., CT scans, MRI), Materials science, Cryo-electron tomography in biology

**Tomogram:** A tomogram is the resulting image or dataset from a tomography process. It represents a 3D reconstruction of the internal features of the scanned object, typically stored as a volumetric dataset composed of multiple slices.

---

**Voxel:** A voxel, short for "volumetric pixel," is the three-dimensional equivalent of a pixel in a 2D image. It represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space.

---

**Voxel Spacing:** Voxel spacing refers to the physical distance between the centers of adjacent voxels (volumetric pixels) in a 3D dataset. It determines the resolution of the tomogram and is often expressed in units like nanometers (nm), micrometers (Âµm), or millimeters (mm).
For Example: **Voxel Size**: \( 10 \, \text{nm} \). Indicates that each voxel in the dataset represents a cube with \( 10 \, \text{nm} \) sides in the real world.
